Coffee Bot is a small robot that offers simple small talk, activated by the keyword $coffeechat. You can engage in simple chats with it through different button options. 
However, it's important to note that Coffee bot is a bit of a naughty robot. It loves coffee and enjoys making jokes. Additionally, because it originates from Asia, it assumes that everyone chatting with it is lactose intolerant:)

Originally, I wanted to add the two options “Yes” and “No” after "Milk Tea?", but I encountered some problems when writing the code, so I simplified the logic.
