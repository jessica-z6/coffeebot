Introducing Coffee Bot, your delightful companion for engaging coffee chats right on Discord! Sparked to life with a simple $coffeechat command, Coffee Bot is more than just a digital barista. It's a conversation starter, a tiny robot eager to indulge in simple yet engaging small talk through an array of button options. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or your tastes lie elsewhere, Coffee Bot is here to accommodate your preferences and spark engaging dialogues.

How It Works:
At the heart of Coffee Bot's interaction is a straightforward yet captivating question: Do you like coffee? Your answer paves the way for a tailored chat experience
* Yes: Delighted by your affinity for coffee, it inquires further, "With milk and syrup?" Whether you're indulging in the creamy sweetness or you prefer your coffee black and bold, Coffee Bot has a charming remark ready:
    * Yes: "Hope you're not lactose intolerant :)" – a playful nod to milk lovers everywhere.
    * No: "A kind and healthy black coffee lover ;)" – celebrating the simplicity and robustness of black coffee.
* No: Not a coffee fan? No problem! Coffee Bot warmly asks, "So you like tea or something else? There is a place for all drinkers." It's an open invitation to share your drink of choice, ensuring that everyone feels included, regardless of their preferences.

# Previous vision
Coffee Bot is a small robot that offers simple small talk, activated by the keyword $coffeechat. You can engage in simple chats with it through different button options. 

However, it's important to note that the Coffee bot is a bit of a naughty robot. It loves coffee and enjoys making jokes. Additionally, because it originates from Asia, it assumes that everyone chatting with it is lactose intolerant:)

I wanted to add the two options “Yes” and “No” after "Milk Tea?", but I encountered some problems when writing the code, the bottom for "Milk Tea?" appear at the first chat, so I simplified the logic.
